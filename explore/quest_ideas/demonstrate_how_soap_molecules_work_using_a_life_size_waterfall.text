Using a (ingame) life sized water fall that contains the secretions of a special type of water that has the similar properties as soap to flow into an interactive pond to demonstrate how germs can confused their structure of eight/ten legs with the molecule structure and thus gravitate towards the soap molecules by detecting the shapes using the air pressure differences or liquid pressure differences to determine shape, the germs are unable to communicate with one another and thus refuse to not only reproduce but also are so overwhelmed with not being able to share(communicate) by means of the force and bubbling(self replicating nature of soap) that the germs end up dying.
The player will only get the small molecules stuck to them instead of being over welmed and dying.
I guess the germs can be reproduced from a stagnant/still water pond overflowing with germs that thrive off eachother and reproduce based on sharing at

Their excrement but the main work should focus on demonstrating how and why soap is more important then just plain water at killing and absorbing germs.
