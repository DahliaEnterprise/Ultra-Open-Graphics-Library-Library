This folder is allocated for the project of creating an interactive movie(game?!) that will be purely on the positive persona with some mixed dark scenes and humor. Probably rated mature 17years and older. 
The main purpose of the interactive movie is to be placed into scenarios that we are all sure we know how it works as a society however these situations never come up in an isolated manner(usually they are within a collective manner),
Player(s) will be asked to find something (of color) green and or narrow pad, or just a pad.
To trace a line and report back to the appropriate sector(company). To mix colors.
Jump on junk to swish it in with out being stuck inside.

The purpose is to have art to look at with a purpose. Staring at art trains and triggers the mind to unintentionally and purposefully become board due to a supposed lack of benefits. However interactive art pieces will trigger and train the mind to not only become more attentive(a naturally self regulation attention span) but also naturally be drawn to art and how things and people around them can be entertaining with out paying for something and or directly benefiting such as eating food and or becoming intoxicated.

I'd imagine the game would be single player with multiplayer allowances.
Everything must be accomplishable with a single player however if multiple people are around then it can be achieveable through multiple people if consent is intentionally given by means of a "friends" system. Non friends can still talk to eachother using a usersbook mark system.
